Project is almost done. All the classes have been implemented. Implemented classes are:
 - GUI
 - SimulationPanel
 - Bird
 - Group
 - Behaviour
 - Vector
 - Matrix2

The classes 'Behaviour' and 'Matrix2' had not been taken into account in the original plan. 'Behaviour' -class is responsible for implementing
the flocking behaviour. 'Matrix2' is a helper class for 2x2 matrices and it implements some common matrix operations.

The functionality of 'Vector' and 'Matrix2' classes has been confirmed using the VectorUnitTests and MatrixUnitTests objects. The functionality
of other classes has been confirmed using a visual examination. The functionality of GUI elements has been confirmed by testing the different
elements.

The project has progressed without any major issues. Most issues have been solved and only some minor tweaking is left to be done e.g. The
default flocking behaviour and GUI tweaks. 

The program is now fully functional. The project has been worked on at this moment for about 20 hours. The remaining hours are about 5 or less.
Regarding the schedule, I'm almost on schedule. The project is almost complete only some very minor tweaks are remaining.

I have not done much for the project since all important functionalities have been implemented.

I have tweaked the default simulation arguments and made some minor refactoring.

Time spent is around 1 hour. I'm on schedule since project is now almost complete.

The only thing remaining is to optimize the default arguments for simulation. Have to find a good set of default values where the movement is most natural looking.
